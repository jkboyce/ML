# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

This is a Tensorflow-based project I worked on as part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. It constructs a relatively simple network that classifies images in the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of ten categories. After training it achieves an accuracy of about 70% on this task.

# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier project

This is a Tensorflow-based project I worked on as part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. It builds and trains a convolutional neural network that classifies images in the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) into one of ten categories.

The network architecture is three convolutional layers, followed by three fully-connected layers to 10 softmax outputs. In total there are 396800 trainable parameters in the network. After training the network achieves an accuracy of about 70% on this classification task.

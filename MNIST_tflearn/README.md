# MNIST TFLearn project

This was a project I did that builds and trains a neural network to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST data set. It uses the TFLearn library on top of Tensorflow.

The network is a simple three-leyer fully connected network. After training it achieves a classification accuracy of about 95% on test data.
